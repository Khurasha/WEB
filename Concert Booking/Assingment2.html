                    Grigahcine was born in Paris to a French father and an Algerian mother and grew up in Ermont,a banlieue district outside Paris, which he describes as a ghetto.He cites a scene with Cut Killer in the French film La Haine as well as hip-hop artists KRS-One and Cypress Hill as early influences. In his youth, Grigahcine produced graffiti art, earning him the moniker "Snake" because he was able to consistently evade the police. Of his name, Grigahcine says 'Snake' in my city first, I was like 'DJ Snake, OK let's go for it.' The name sucks, but it's too late now.He started DJing at age 14, and later producing at 19.In his early career, Grigahcine performed at clubs including Les Bains Douches in Paris. .

                    After seeing DJ Snake countless of times, I can say for certain that he never disappoints. His sets are electrifying and keeps the crowd's energy peaking throughout. His music transitions from a mix of hip hop, trap, and even sprinkles in some latin vibes here and there.
