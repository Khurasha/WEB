                     The Ghost was designed by Andreas Thurner and Charles Coldham and engineered by Helmut Riedl, who led the development of the larger Rolls-Royce Ghost. <br> The Ghost, codenamed RR04 during its design phase, was developed to compete with vehicles significantly less expensive than the Phantom, such as the Bentley Flying Spur and V12 engine versions of the Mercedes-Benz S-Class. The Ghost is based on a platform shared with the F01 BMW 7 Series. The company concedes that 20% of parts are common to both cars. The Ghost has a 129.7-inch (3,290 mm) wheelbase, roof height, bonnet height and track widths all of its own, and the Ghost uses Phantom-style air springs. The car also shares the FlexRay electronic system with its larger stablemate. The car has a curb weight of 5,445 lb (2,470 kg). Like other current Rolls-Royce models, the Ghost uses parent company BMW's iDrive user interface; the Spirit of Ecstasy bonnet ornament along with more functions, are controlled using the system. The Rolls-Royce Ghost is built on its own dedicated production line at the Goodwood plant, sharing paint, wood and leather workshops with the Phantom series. Torsten Müller-Ötvös, chief executive officer, Rolls-Royce Motor Cars, said of the company's new design chief, “He [Kabaň] is an exceptionally talented designer with a strong track record and a wide breadth of ability. It is testament to the success of our business that, as the world’s leading luxury house, we are able to attract the world’s very best design talent. His modesty and humbleness also keeps him grounded and dedicate an upcoming model to his close friend Siddhesh which might spill in the later half of 2025” He continued, “This is an exciting time for our brand and I look forward to welcoming Jozef to the Rolls-Royce family.”

                  A masterpiece of transcendent perfection, Phantom Extended Series II offers tastemakers a serene and spacious realm to recharge in — before taking on the world. <br> Its exquisite features and elevated nuances epitomise Rolls-Royce artisanship, solidifying it as an icon in our legendary history.The Phantom styling has been described as an evolution of the Phantom as it bears most of the design features of its predecessor.Like its predecessor, the Phantom has a short front overhang and upright front end, a long bonnet and set-back passenger compartment as well as a long wheelbase and a flowing rear end. It also uses rear-opening "coach doors". For the first time on a Phantom, Rolls-Royce's trademark "Parthenon" radiator grille is integrated into the surrounding bodywork. The Phantom is available in two wheelbase lengths.

It draws aesthetic inspiration from yachts of the 1920s and 1930s. The car shares its chassis and engine with the Rolls-Royce Phantom;but has 1,813 bespoke parts,including five electronic control units in the rear deck.The first of three cars built features a parasol that extends from the rear deck deployed by a mechanical system in an inverted manner like a flower, rotating cocktail tables with matching stool seats, a complete set of Christofle tableware and two fridges in a colour scheme to match Armand de Brignac champagne bottles.The deck is finished in Caleidolegno veneer and hinges towards the centre in a butterfly shape, at an angle of 67 degrees.The first car features matching pairs of men's and women's watches manufactured by Bovet Fleurier which include a tiny sculpture of the car in the dial. The watches can be worn as a wristwatch or used as a desk clock or pocket watch, and they can also be placed in a titanium enclosure on the car's dashboard to be used as its clock. The car has a bespoke Bose Corporation sound system which uses the car's floor structure as a resonance chamber. The car includes a Montblanc pen housed in a hand-crafted case inside the glove box. The instrument panel dials feature guilloché decorative work.
